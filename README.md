# MarriedMoles
Created for class. The classic rabbits and foxes simulator with some added mole romance drama and bombs. If a male and female mole are within a certain 
attractiveness level of each other, they get married and have children. However the male mole may cheat with another female mole. If this happens, the previous female
mole has a chance of dropping a bomb that clears the surrounding area (including the rabbits and foxes).
Male mole: light blue- not married, blue- married, yellowgreen - cheater. Female mole: light pink - not married, pink- married. Bomb is red, foxes are grey, 
rabbits are orange.
